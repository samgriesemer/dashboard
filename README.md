# Dashboard

This a clean, minimal dashboard built with raw HTML, CSS, and JS. No libraries are used, just a simple CSS grid and some API's. The grid layout is used to make things modular to some degree, so modify it as you see fit!

## Demo

You can visit a live version of the dashboard [here](https://smgr.io/dashboard).

## Contents & Usage

This repo contains the HTML layout, CSS styling, and recurring Javascript API calls that populate the dashboard. If you'd like to use the dashboard for youself, simply clone the repo and enter your API keys for the services you intend to use. I haven't had time to really extend this so let me know if you add to it!
